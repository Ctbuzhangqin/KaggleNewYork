The objective of this project is to establish a machine learning model to predict the total travel time of taxis in New York City. The primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables. By analyzing these data sets, we can not only predict the travel time of passengers, but also mine more detailed information about urban travel behavior. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively predict travel time.
